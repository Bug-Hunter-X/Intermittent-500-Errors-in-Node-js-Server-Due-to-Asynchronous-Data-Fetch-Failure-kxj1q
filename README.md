# Intermittent 500 Errors in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications where an asynchronous operation can fail unexpectedly, causing intermittent 500 errors.  The problem is exacerbated by inadequate error handling, resulting in an unstable server response.

The `bug.js` file showcases the faulty implementation.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and resilience.
